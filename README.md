# Palmoria-Group-HR-Analysis

This case study highlights a key gender gap concern for a Nigerian based manufacturing company which was tagged as a 'manufacturing patriach'. Given the business vision of expansion to other possible locations, this was not a good conotation for their brand. Hence, we conducted an in depth analysis on data driven information in areas surrounding the gender situation of the company across their Lagos, Abuja and kaduna branches.

This analysis was carried out using data and insights from some of the managers, and we deployed a business intelligence tool [POWER BI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=58494) to present results that will aid the management address the gender related issues, if any.

The managers provided specific areas of concern, which we took a deep dive into and the analysis are presented below using the respective pointers.

## 1. Gender Distribution Analysis (Departmental/Regional)

The first case scenario was to visualize the gender situation of the company with respect to the different departments in different regions. Here, we reported the regional-gender situation using a stacked bar chart where the number of persons per gender (male,female,undisclosed) are presented in the figure. Then we added a slicer to  visualize the departmental outcome per gender and region and the overall gender distribution

## 2. Rating Insights from Gender

In this section, we created a report to show the perfromance ratings with respect to the gender using a pie chart. The results reveal a variation across the different modalities stated (ratings/gender) through a slicer to distill different parameters within the frame oof gender vs rating.

## 3. Gender Pay Gap vis a vis Department/Region
In order to identify if there is a gender pay gap, the gender/salary situation was presented on a scatter plot, which revealed that a there was a difference in the total pay across the different genders with the male gender being highest. Furthermore, the average salary was calculated indicating a slight difference and a pay gap ratio was included to show the gender/pay disparity (male-female) across different departments in the different regions. This was presented on a table and some departments had a ratio greater than one(1), indicating that the male gender was paid more in some departments. This issues therefore should be adressed by management based on their underlying HR policies, systemic structures

## 4. Expression of Minimun salary 

With a recent regulation requiring manufacturing companies to pay a minimum salary of $90,000, we sought to verify if Palmoria's HR pay policies were policies were compliant. To this effect, we created a measure to filter and count employees below the minimum wage. Then we presented the results on a a bar chat which reveal that Palmoria does not meet the requirement as up to 654 employees across the 3 regions had a minimun salary of $90,000. The analysis went further to present employee salary bands grouped in $10,000s.

## 5. Salary and Bonuses
To adress the allocation of bonuses to individual employees, we retrieved data from the custom column created during data transformation and uploaded in to a table visual to show the bonus amount for individual employees. Then we established the total salary including the bonus amount for individual employees on a table. In final analysis, we visualized the total amount the company pays as salary by region and company wide.
