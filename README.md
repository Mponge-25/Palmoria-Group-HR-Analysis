This case study highlights a key gender gap concern for a Nigerian based manufacturing company which was tagged as a 'manufacturing patriach'. Given the business vision of expansion to other possible locations, this was not a good conotation for their brand. Hence, we conducted an in depth analysis on data driven information in areas surrounding the gender situation of the company across their Lagos, Abuja and kaduna branches.

This analysis was carried out using data and insights from some of the managers, and we deployed a business intelligence tool [POWER BI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=58494) to present results that will aid the management address the gender related issues, if any.

The managers provided specific areas of concern, which we took a deep dive into and the analysis are presented below using the respective pointers.

The first case scenario was to visualize the gender situation of the company with respect to the different departments in different regions. Here, we reported the regional-gender situation using a stacked bar chart where the number of persons per gender (male,female,undisclosed) are presented in the figure. Then we added a slicer to  visualize the departmental outcome per gender and region and the overall gender distribution
